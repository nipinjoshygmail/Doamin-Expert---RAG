# Doamin-Expert---RAG
This is a comprehensive Python Flask application that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, Audio, etc.), indexes them into a vector database, and then uses a local Large Language Model (via Ollama) to answer questions based only on the content of those uploaded documents.
